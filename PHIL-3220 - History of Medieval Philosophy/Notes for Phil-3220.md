[[OSU Notes Spring 2026]]



### Lecture One - 1/15/2025

**Reading Response Assignments**
Final grade will be out of 4, lowest 2 will be dropped (there are 6). These will be responses to the reading for that class. response should be *only* to the main reading [s] for that class.

What is philosophy: The Love of Wisdom.
Three branches of philosophy: 
**Metaphysics:** The study of existence, reality, and being. *Does God Exist*, *Of what am I made*, *Do we have souls*
**Epistemology:** The study/theory of knowledge, truth, and learning. 
 - *What is the difference between fact and opinion*, *is my truth your truth, or does everyone have their own truth(s)? 
 **Ethics:** The study of the good and what we should do
 - *What makes for a good human life?* *What is happiness?*
In short: what is real, how do I and we know, and how should I and we live?

**Medieval philosophy: the forgotten era**
- philosophy scholar Anthony Kenny (c. 1987) started arguing that medieval philosophy was the forgotten area, enormously important, but barely discussed in universities.
- (History of Medieval Philosophy at OSU: not taught very often these days)
- One reason medieval philosophy is somewhat taboo: it is a fusion of monotheistic theology and earlier pagan Greek philosophy.
   - Monotheistic theology: study of One True God in Judaism (c. 2000 BCE), Christianity (c. 3rd cent. CE), and Islam (7th cent. CE).
   - Many philosophers shy away from the God stuff, but we will talk a lot about it out of necessity.


### Lecture Two - Plato 01/20/2026 [[Plato - excerpts (Foltz).pdf]]
- Plato: 425 - 347 BCE, wealthy Athenian, student of Socrates, founder of the academy, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.
   - Wrote dialogues depicting Socrates in conversation with other famous and infamous figures, including politicians, artists, common folk, and some philosophers.
- A . A . Whitehead: "The European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato."
- Essential to remember: these are pagan thinkers! They've never heard of monotheistic theology
     - For them, "divine" means that which is eternal, self-same, and unchanging. 
 - What the soul is, is very hard to say. Here's a nice story, a myth that sort of captures it:
 - for us mortals, the souls is like a chariot with two horses one good and one bad
 - Gods have two good horses that guide their chariots up to the heavens, where they can gaze upon Really Real Reality.
      - Really real Reality is not at all the stuff around us, but the divine, or that which makes all this stuff around us possible
- Our horses fight, however, with the good one leading us upward, and the bad one leading us downward.
     - Philosophy is our little slice of divine-like inquiry, when the good horse is leading!
     - The bad horse leads us "back to earth", where we pursue bodily pleasures and neglect to understand Really Real Reality!
 - What our world is -- the universe, or the cosmos - is also very hard to say. Here's another nice story, another myth:
 - The cosmos is a thing that has come to be, made as an image of the eternal and divine by a crafts-person (demiourgus) who is good.
     - The crafts-person wanted *everything to be as good and divine-like as possible*
     - This happens by looking to the divine model to bring order to chaos
- Takeaways: the crafts-person made the cosmos *as good as possible* by making it *like* the divine, something that "came before" it and hence has a kind of priority over it.

- Symposium
- A lesson on *how we come to know beauty itself, that is, divine beauty:*
    - Study beauty in one particular context: one body.
    - the study beauty in another body, and another, learning to find it in *all bodies*
    - Then come to understand beauty in non-bodily contexts: systems of knowledge, complexity of laws of physics and science. Study sameness of beauty across instances, in varying levels of complexity!
    - Suddenly, "in a flash", come to know beauty itself, *what makes possible these various instances of beauty*.
- Two important points: 
    - The properties that physical things have (beauty, redness, etc.) are made possible through *ways of being* ("beauty itself") that are in some sense divine.
    - To come to understand the divine, *study sameness and difference across instances*
- Seeing requires those things: the seer (eye), the thing seen, and light.
- The sun hence is the *cause* of the seeing, *a third thing* that is the *causal source* of the seeing
- The good is exactly like this, but for knowing instead of seeing
- Knowing entails a knower (person), the thing known, and the good, *that by which* the thing is known is "illuminated" to allow for knowing.
- (this seems extremely important, but Plato has Socrates say only a tiny bit about it in the dialogues)

 ### Lecture Three - Aristotle 01/22/2026 [[Aristotle - excerpts (Foltz).pdf]]
Aristotle
- Aristotle: Plato's most famous student, and (more of less) equally important in the history of philosophy.
- Often said to be "bitter enemy" of Plato, but this is a distortion. They agree on a lot! Medieval scholars certainly thought so too.
- Plato is particularly interested in "the heavens" or higher reality that makes our world possible, while Aristotle is particularly interested in "our world": studying biology, laws of physics, human societies and politics, works of art...
- But Aristotle agrees with Plato: the objects of "our world" are as they are due to *divine, causal principles*.
Aristotle and Plato on divine causes
- the things we see around us *all come to be and perish*
- They are spatiotemporally determined: their attributes change over time and as they move across space.
     - Take the tree. 100 years ago, it was an acorn. In 50 years, it will be a pile of lumber.
     - this is only coherent if we posit *ways of being*: acorn-ness, tree-ness, lumber-ness
     - These ways of being - *what it is to be an acorn, a tree, or lumber - do not themselves change!* What changes are *this* acorn, *that* tree, *this* lumber!
- For Plato and Aristotle, ways of being are hence "eternal", and hence "divine."
- (These are often called "forms" as in "Plato's theory of forms" though Aristotle surely agrees with a version of this theory.)
- Ways of being ("forms") are hence (1) divine, (2) eternal, (3) unchanging, (4) causal, (5) the *reason* for spatiotemporal things being as they are over periods of time.
