[[OSU Notes Spring 2026]]



### Lecture One - 1/15/2025

**Reading Response Assignments**
Final grade will be out of 4, lowest 2 will be dropped (there are 6). These will be responses to the reading for that class. response should be *only* to the main reading [s] for that class.

What is philosophy: The Love of Wisdom.
Three branches of philosophy: 
**Metaphysics:** The study of existence, reality, and being. *Does God Exist*, *Of what am I made*, *Do we have souls*
**Epistemology:** The study/theory of knowledge, truth, and learning. 
 - *What is the difference between fact and opinion*, *is my truth your truth, or does everyone have their own truth(s)? 
 **Ethics:** The study of the good and what we should do
 - *What makes for a good human life?* *What is happiness?*
In short: what is real, how do I and we know, and how should I and we live?

**Medieval philosophy: the forgotten era**
- philosophy scholar Anthony Kenny (c. 1987) started arguing that medieval philosophy was the forgotten area, enormously important, but barely discussed in universities.
- (History of Medieval Philosophy at OSU: not taught very often these days)
- One reason medieval philosophy is somewhat taboo: it is a fusion of monotheistic theology and earlier pagan Greek philosophy.
   - Monotheistic theology: study of One True God in Judaism (c. 2000 BCE), Christianity (c. 3rd cent. CE), and Islam (7th cent. CE).
   - Many philosophers shy away from the God stuff, but we will talk a lot about it out of necessity.


### Lecture Two 01/20/2026
- Plato: 425 - 347 BCE, wealthy Athenian, student of Socrates, founder of the academy, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.
   - Wrote dialogues depicting Socrates in conversation with other famous and infamous figures, including politicians, artists, common folk, and some philosophers.
- A . A . Whitehead: "The European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato."
- Essential to remember: these are pagan thinkers! They've never heard of monotheistic theology
     - For them, "divine" means that which is eternal, self-same, and unchanging. 
 - What the soul is, is very hard to say. Here's a nice story, a myth that sort of captures it:
 - for us mortals, the souls is like a chariot with two horses one good and one bad
 - Gods have two good horses that guide their chariots up to the heavens, where they can gaze upon Really Real Reality.
      - Really real Reality is not at all the stuff around us, but the divine, or that which makes all this stuff around us possible
- Our horses fight, however, with the good one leading us upward, and the bad one leading us downward.
     - Philosophy is our little slice of divine-like inquiry, when the good horse is leading!
     - The bad horse leads us "back to earth", where we pursue bodily pleasures and neglect to understand Really Real Reality!
